# Carbide Images API

The database of hardened images for rancher government carbide resides in our secured cloud. This stateless API should act as a simple interface to such.

## Build
```bash
# compile the binary
make
# for more options try
make help
```
## Develop
```bash
# This will start the api and hot reload such whenever changes are saved to a .go file.
./reload.sh
```
## Deploy
Bare-metal, docker, and k8s deployments are all supported - though k8s is recommended.
```bash
helm install carbide-images-api ./chart --values <values-file>
```
## Testing
For now an insomnia file can be found at `./example/exampleQueries.json`.
If you prefer to use the OSS version try [insomnium](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium)
If you prefer to use cURL or a programming language to test the endpoints the queries can be exported to those as well.

If you don't have access to a mysql database available for testing, you can deploy one to your local cluster with the [mysql operator](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-operator)
You can either follow their instructions or run `./bin/mysql.sh` which should deploy their operator and create a test cluster.
